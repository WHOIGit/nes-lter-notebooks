# nes-lter-notebooks
Jupyter notebooks related to [the NES-LTER data system](https://github.com/WHOIGit/nes-lter-ims).

As of 2019-01-03 there are problems with rendering notebooks in GitHub, and apparently developers at GitHub are working on the issue.

In the meantime you can do the following:

* Right-click on a notebook link and copy the link to your clipboard (e.g., that's called "copy link location" in Firefox and "copy link address" in Chrome)
* Paste it into the text box at [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and press "Go"
* You should see the notebook render, for example [this notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WHOIGit/nes-lter-notebooks/blob/master/stanley_discrete_toi_endeavor.ipynb)
