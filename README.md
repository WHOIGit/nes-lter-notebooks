Jupyter notebooks related to NES-LTER

There are currently problems  with rendering notebooks in GitHub, and apparently developers at GitHub are working on the issue.

In the meantime you can do the following:

* Right-click on a notebook link and copy the link to your clipboard (e.g., that's called "copy link location" in Firefox and "copy link address" in Chrome)
* Paste it into the text box at [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and press "Go"
